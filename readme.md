# Slack Chat Textify

I was tired of copy-pasting conversations into documents and then dealing with the formatting issues.

So, this script pulls from the Slack API and somewhat prettifies the text so that you can copy-paste at your leisure.

This script is quickly thrown together. For example, it does not pagination currently. Configure at will!

# Usage

Get a slack token. `slack-term` maintains a list of methods to do this here https://github.com/erroneousboat/slack-term/wiki#running-slack-term-without-legacy-tokens.

Then run `TOKEN=xxxyyyzzz crystal $channelid`.
